[A16] Backup Generators
--------------------------------
Backup generators provide a stopgap to prevent black/brownouts when battery reserves are depleted. They're fuel-expensive, so don't rely on them for consistent power!

Features
--------------------------------
* Generators start producing power when connected reserves are critically low (&lt;= 200 Wd) and stop when reserves exceed 1000 Wd or their power is flicked off/on
* Wood and Chemfuel versions are provided; the chemfuel version unlocks upon researching Refining

Specifics
--------------------------------
* Each generator type should appear in the Power category when the research requirements are fulfilled (see: Change Log)
* Backup generators only work on power grids with connected batteries
* Backup generators consume several times more fuel than Vanilla fueled generators when active; they're really only meant for emergencies
* Generators consume some fuel even when idling, although less than power-producing Vanilla fueled generators
* Chemfuel backup generators are twice as efficient as their wood-fueled counterparts, both when idle and providing power

Feedback Welcome
--------------------------------
Let me know if there are bugs, balance issues, or features you'd like to see!

Change Log
--------------------------------
2017/04/06, 1.0: Initial release

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2017/04/06, 1.1: Balance tweaks
* Wood backup generators now last ~1 season/load idle and ~1 day/load running
* Chemfuel backup generators now last ~1 year/load idle and ~4 days/load running
* Both generators now require MultiAnalyzer research instead of just Electricity.
* Chemfuel still requires Refining research.

Roadmap
--------------------------------
* ~Balance tweaks~
* Install/uninstall capability
* Advanced 1x1 versions (more research and a few rarer resources; probably a bit more efficient still)
* On/off thresholds configurability
* Other options?
