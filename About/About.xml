  <description>Backup generators provide a stopgap to prevent black/brownouts when battery reserves are depleted. They're fuel-expensive, so don't rely on them for consistent power!

    &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Generators start producing power when connected reserves are critically low (<= 200 Wd) and stop when reserves exceed 1000 Wd or their power is flicked off/on
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Wood and Chemfuel versions are provided; the chemfuel version unlocks upon researching Refining
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;size=24&gt;Specifics&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Backup generators only work on power grids with connected batteries
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Backup generators consume several times more fuel than Vanilla fueled generators when active; they're really only meant for emergencies
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Generators consume some fuel even when idling, although less than power-producing Vanilla fueled generators
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Chemfuel backup generators are twice as efficient as their wood-fueled counterparts, both when idle and providing power
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;size=24&gt;Feedback Welcome&lt;/size&gt;
