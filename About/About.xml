  <targetVersion>0.16.0</targetVersion>
  <description>Backup generators provide a stopgap to prevent black/brownouts when battery reserves are depleted. They're fuel-expensive, so don't rely on them for consistent power!

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
* Generators start producing power when connected reserves are critically low (&lt;= 200 Wd) and stop when reserves exceed 1000 Wd or their power is flicked off/on
* Wood and Chemfuel versions are provided; the chemfuel version unlocks upon researching Refining

&lt;size=24&gt;Specifics&lt;/size&gt;
* Backup generators only work on power grids with connected batteries
* Backup generators consume several times more fuel than Vanilla fueled generators when active; they're really only meant for emergencies
* Generators consume some fuel even when idling, although less than power-producing Vanilla fueled generators
* Chemfuel backup generators are twice as efficient as their wood-fueled counterparts, both when idle and providing power

&lt;size=24&gt;Feedback Welcome&lt;/size&gt;
Let me know if there are bugs, balance issues, or features you'd like to see!
